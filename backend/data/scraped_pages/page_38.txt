The estimated total number of students at UTA who are eligible to participate in programs under Section 484 in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and thus eligible to receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act is 47,237.
The total number of students who have received an Emergency Financial Aid Grant to students under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act as of February 22, 2022 is 19,983.
The method(s) used by the institution to determine which students receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants and how much they would receive under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act are as follows:
Students who completed the CARES Act/HEERF Emergency Grant fund application through the Student Homepage of the MyMav account.
Award priority will be given to students with the highest need as demonstrated either through the calculated EFC from the FAFSA or other factors. The date eligible students complete the application will also be used in making awards.
Students without a FAFSA must include information on the application to explain their need for the funds. These applications will be reviewed by staff to determine eligibility.
Standard amounts will be awarded through an automated process with the goal to assist as many students as possible with a meaningful dollar amount. Awards may be made for other amounts based on specific needs.
Instructions, directions, or guidance provided by the institution to students concerning the Emergency Financial Aid Grants are:
