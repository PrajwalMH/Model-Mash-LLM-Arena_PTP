McNair Scholars
The
McNair Scholars
Program is a competitive program funded by the U.S. Department of Education to prepare university juniors and seniors who are low-income, first generation, and/or underrepresented in graduate education for doctoral education.Â This program assists students in the attainment of their educational, professional, and personal goals through participation in research and other academic/scholarly activities.
Named for physicist and astronaut Dr. Ronald E. McNair, the program was designed to increase Ph.D. awards for students from underrepresented/underserved segments of society. McNair Scholars are undergraduates preparing for doctoral studies through involvement in a summer research internship and other scholarly activities.
Applications for Spring 2025 are due by November 15, 2024.

A major component of the McNair program is the Summer Research Internship, which takes place during the summer (late May - early August) between the junior and senior year. Scholars, who receive a stipend of $4,000, are required to participate in this aspect of the program, as it is crucial to developing their knowledge and research skills in preparation for graduate study.
What are the Benefits of McNair Scholars?
The UTA McNair Scholars Program offers a wide array of services to aid participants to reach their full academic and professional potential: informative seminars, the McNair research institute and summer research internship, help with the graduate school application process, conference participation, and other benefits. Participating fully in all aspects of the program enables Scholars to gain admittance to well-ranked graduate programs nationwide and to receive the funding necessary to earn the Ph.D.

The McNair Scholars Program came to UTA in 1989-1990 and has been refunded continuously since its arrival. The first grant was written by Kathryn Head, former director of what was then known as SOAR (Students Obtaining Academic Readiness). Over the years the program has worked with many bright and hard-working students who have gone on to acquire graduate degrees and often enter the teaching profession.
