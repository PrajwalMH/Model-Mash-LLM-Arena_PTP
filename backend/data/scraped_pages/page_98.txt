Meet Brianna
I truly love UTA’s welcoming atmosphere, the beautiful campus, and the amazing business program. When I toured other universities, none of them compared to UTA. I’m most excited about being involved on campus, learning new things in my classes, and meeting new people (virtually and socially distanced, of course). What I love most is having so many available opportunities, being able to show my school pride, and the sense of community.

Meet Matthew
This university is unique in a sense that it has the "big university" feel but you never feel disconnected from the students or staff. Professors here are always willing to give you an extra 10 minutes or to meet you outside of class to help you further your learning or experience.  Don't be afraid to speak up or challenge ideas, because what you learn from these constructive confrontations is far more valuable than any textbook reading. My first semester of my MBA program was very beneficial to my professional and social life. I made connections with leaders and student leaders who have pushed me and challenged me to take that next step in my life. From this unconditional support I was able to land an internship with Southwest Airlines, one of the top airline companies in the country and one of the top work/life balance cultures I have ever been a part of.
