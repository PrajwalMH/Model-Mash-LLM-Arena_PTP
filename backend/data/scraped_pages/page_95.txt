Our Organizations
Our 26 sororities and fraternities are as diverse as the university in which we thrive. We have a wide variety of chapters and experiences. The four sorority and fraternity governing councils on this campus (NPHC, MGC, IFC, and CPH) are all different. However, each council has organizations that will embrace you and empower you. All of our chapters do one thing better than any other organization on campus. We #EmpowerUTA.
Want to Join?
Joining a fraternity or sorority is a mutual selection process between students and fraternity/sorority organizations. This means that as you are exploring which organization is the best fit for you, organizations are examining what students are a good fit for their fraternity/sorority. We challenge you to keep an open mind and consider more than one option to ensure you find the best option.
