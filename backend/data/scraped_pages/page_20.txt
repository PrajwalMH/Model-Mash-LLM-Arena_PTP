Meet Amaris
I chose UTA so that I could have a fun college experience not too close and not too far from home. I was so excited to be in the center of the DFW Metroplex, and one of the biggest reasons I came to UTA was the level of diversity among staff and students.
I love being a Maverick because UTA provides resources, safety, and fun to all their students, although this year has been rocky. UTA is doing a great job of making the best of the situation!
