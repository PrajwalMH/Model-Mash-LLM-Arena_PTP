Admission Applications Are Welcome At Any Time.
We will process your application as quickly as possible and every attempt will be made to ensure consideration for the desired semester. Applying early gives you the best opportunity to receive scholarships, as well. Some graduate degree programs with very selective admission procedures may require that you apply nine months to a year in advance in order to be considered, while others may require a much shorter period of time.
Financial Aid and Scholarship Deadlines
UTA also offers a variety of departmental, endowed, and special scholarships. The deadlines dates vary by scholarship. To ensure adequate time for consideration of your application, apply for admission well in advance of your desired starting date. Note that the scholarship and financial aid application deadlines are earlier.
