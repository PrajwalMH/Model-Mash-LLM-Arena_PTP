Partnering with Maverick Families
We know you are critical partners in your studentâ€™s education, and we understand the importance of building a strong relationship with you as soon as your student joins our campus community. Parent & Family Services is dedicated to building and strengthening that relationship by providing opportunities for your family to stay connected, get involved, and seek support. We know that the more informed and connected you are as a family, the better we can work together to help our students achieve their goals. Engaging, educating, and supporting the entire family is three of our top priorities.
