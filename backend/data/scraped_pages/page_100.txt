STEM TUITION FELLOWSHIP
Select Engineering and Science graduate students are eligible to participate in the STEM Fellowship program, designed for doctoral degree seeking students, which will afford them significantly reduced tuition and a graduate assistantship. Fellowship includes monthly stipend, 75% tuition coverage and in-state tuition rate. Requirements include enrollment in a doctoral or doctoral-bound Engineering or Science program, 50% assistantship, full-time enrollment, unconditional admission and academic good standing. New students in either a doctoral or doctoral-bound program may hold the fellowship for up to five years. Interested students should contact their department for more information.
GRADUATE DEAN'S DISSERTATION FELLOWSHIP
This fellowship is intended to support doctoral students in the final stage of completing their doctoral dissertations. Fellowship includes a stipend and tuition at the in-state rate. Requirements include doctoral or doctoral-bound summer enrollment, good academic standing, and being at the final stage of dissertation work. These awards will be offered to doctoral students with approved dissertation proposals or prospectuses who have completed all or most of the research needed to complete their dissertations. These studentsâ€™ efforts should therefore be focused largely on writing their dissertations. Award recipients may not hold any other forms of employment during fellowship term. Interested students must apply through their college or school, and not directly to the Office of Graduate Studies.
I ENGAGE MENTORING (IM) PROGRAM
The IM Program provides funding for doctoral and doctoral-bound students to gain teaching and mentoring experience by serving as a research mentor to a UT Arlington undergraduate. Undergraduates will have the opportunity to work closely with a graduate student mentor on either the mentor's research/creative project or on their own research/creative project. Graduate students will receive a $400 stipend during the term in which they participate in the project.
