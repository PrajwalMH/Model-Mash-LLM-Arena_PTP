OUR BRIGHT FUTURE
Advantageously positioned at the intersection of I-30 and I-20 at the western gateway of Fort Worth in Parker County, the UTA West campus is designed to reflect its ranchland setting. Located mere minutes from downtown Fort Worth, the site features more than 50 acres of rolling hills dotted with wildflowers and live oaks, along with a small lake that inspired us to plan a waterfront park. If you’re lucky and visit at the right time, you might even spot a sea of bluebonnets at our idyllic campus.
